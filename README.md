# Meme_by_HTML-CSS
It's a meme creation by using the image and a little description at the bottom so, Adding the tags like Div, H1, and P. Also in this I have used google form for the different forms and implemented them in the CSS file. In CSS used the heigth, width, border, text-align, Font-Size, text-transform, margins etc..
